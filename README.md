## Introduction
This CLI application allows to user to display the items in the Vending Machine and perform the necessary actions to purchase an item from the machine.
1. The items all have attributes (position, name, price, type, quantity) that are read in from a text file at the start.
2. The user can then choose to add money and can choose an item or items to buy.
3. It will despense the item and will reduce the quantity by 1.
4. The user can repeat these processes until they finish the transaction and exit the program.

This application also has the ability to write to a text file when a transaction occurs and what the user is doing.
There is also a secret option in the main menu that prints out a sales report to show how much money was made and how many of each item were sold.
